This folder contains all extra libraries we need to use the application.

⚠️ You still need the vollt lib in order for this to work.

⚠️ Some of these files may be useless at some point.

If you add any more libs, you can put them here but be careful to add them to your build path too.

Tips : If you don't know how to add jar file to the git, just check the .gitignore file in the root of your clone (hidden file)
and make sure there is not \*.jar in the ignore list.
